## [96. Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/) :star::star::star:

### DP Recurrence Relation

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**: Analyze few cases and generalize recurrence relation.
* f(i): number of possible graph when there are number of i nodes.
```
f(0) = \[None\] = 1 
f(1) = \[1\] = 1

f(2)= f(0)*f(1) + f(1)*f(0) = 2
       [1]    |    [2]
          \   |    /
          [2] |  [1]
     Left: 0  |   Left: 1
     Right: 1 |   Right: 0
f(0)*f(1) = 1 |  f(1)*f(0) = 1
          
          
f(3) = f(0)f(2) + f(1)f(1) + f(2)(0) = 5
  [1]     [1]     |    [2]    |      [3]       [3]
    \       \     |    / \    |      /         /
    [3]     [2]   |  [1] [3]  |    [2]       [1]
    /        \    |           |   /           \
  [2]         [3] |           | [1]           [2]
   Left: 0        |  Left: 1  |        Left:2
   RIght: 2       |  Right: 1 |       Right: 0
   f(0)*f(2) = 2  |f(1)*f(1)=1|   f(2)*f(0) = 2
      
```
$$
\therefore f(n) = \Sigma_{i=0}^{n-1}{f(i)f(n-1-i)}
$$


```python
class Solution(object):
    def numTrees(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        arr = [ 0 for _ in range(n+1)]
        arr[0] = 1
        
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            for j  in range(1,i+1):
                arr[i] += arr[j-1]*arr[i-j]
                
        return arr[-1]
```

## [97. Interleaving String](https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/) :star::star::star:

### 2-D DP

Time Complexity: $$O(m\times n)$$

Space Complexity: $$O(m \times n)$$

**Key-Point**:


```python
```
### 1-D DP

Time Complexity: $$O(m\times n)$$

Space Complexity: $$O(n)$$

**Key-Point**: Using 1-D array as memoization

```python


```

## [98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/) :star::star::star:

### Binary Tree

Time Complexity: $$O(n)$$

Space Complexity: $$O(n)$$

**Key-Point**: Keep  max and min value of node range

```python


```
