## [114. Flatten Binary Tree To Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/) :star::star:

### Recursive

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**: Attach left node to right node, and connect previous right node to the deepest right node from newly attached node

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def flatten(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        
        if not root:
            return
        
        if root.left:
            tempNode = root.right
            curNode = root.left
            # find deepest right node
            while curNode.right:
                curNode = curNode.right
                
            curNode.right = tempNode
            root.right = root.left
            root.left = None
            
        self.flatten(root.right)

```

### Flatten From bottom :star::star::star:
Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**: Go down to the deepest right node. As we go up, we set previous node as right node.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.prev = None

    def flatten(self, root):
        if not root:
            return None
        self.flatten(root.right)
        self.flatten(root.left)

        root.right = self.prev
        root.left = None
        self.prev = root
```

## [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/) :star::star:

### Using Set

Time Complexity: $$O(n)$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**: Alway start from the smallest one

```python

```


## [129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/) :star::star:

### DFS

Time Complexity: $$O(n)$$
