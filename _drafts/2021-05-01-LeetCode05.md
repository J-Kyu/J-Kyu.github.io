## [91. Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/) :star::star:

### 

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**: When single digit is valid, we add from ``dp[i-1]``. When double digit is valide we add ``dp[i-1]`` with ``dp[i-2]``.
Single Digit dp[i] += dp[i-1]
Double Digit dp[i] += dp[i-2]   (dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2])
To be more specific, when given number is "216", the ``dp`` will be formed as following.
 
 Index] 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
        ------------------ 
value]    | 2 | 1 | 6 |
        ==================
dp]     1 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
 
 
``dp[2]`` is equal to 2 because both value ``2`` and ``23`` is valid. 
``dp[3]'' is equal to 3 because ``16`` and ``6`` is valid. Also previous value ``2`` and ``23`` is valid. Thus adding ``dp[i-1]`` and ``dp[i-2]`` is valid way to decode ``216``.



```python

        :type s: str
        :rtype: int

        #dp: accumulate valid one (2 cases)
        #s =    | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1
        #    --------------------
        #dp   1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1
        
        
        
        dp = [ 0 for _ in range(len(s)+1)]
        
        if not s or s[0] == "0":
            return 0
            
        dp[0] = 1
        
        for i in range(1,len(s)+1):
            
            # single digit  1~9
            if s[i-1] != "0":
                dp[i] += dp[i-1]
                
            # double digit    09~27  (value between 01~09 is already been considered from above condition ) 
            if i > 1 and s[i-2:i] < "27" and s[i-2:i] > "09":
                dp[i] += dp[i-2]
                
                
        return dp[len(s)]
