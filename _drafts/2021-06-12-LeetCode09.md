## [130. Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/) :star::star:

### Using mask

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**:  Either true or false board or change definite "o" to "d" to indicate it is actual  "o"


```python

```
## [130. Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/) :star::star::star:

### DFS

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**:  Backtraking (use parition)


```python

```

### DP

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$
