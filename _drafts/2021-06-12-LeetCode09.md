## [130. Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/) :star::star:

### Start From Border

Time Complexity: $$O(N^2)$$

Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$

**Key-Point**:  Star from border side. Any grid that is related to boarder 'O', flip it into  '-'. At the end filp all the '-' to 'O' and flip rest into 'X'.


```python
class Solution(object):
    def solve(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        row = len(board)
        column = len(board[0])
        
        
        def Flip(board,r,c):
            
            if r < 0  or r >= row or c < 0 or c >= column:
                return
            
            if board[r][c] != 'O':
                return
            
            board[r][c] = '-'
            
            dir = [[1,0],[-1,0],[0,1],[0,-1]]
            for i in dir:
                Flip(board,r+i[0],c+i[1])
                
        
        #  hem
        for i in range(column):
            
            Flip(board,0,i)
            Flip(board,row-1,i)
            
        for i in range(1,row-1):
            Flip(board,i,0)
            Flip(board,i,column-1)
            
        for i in range(row):
            for j in range(column):
                if board[i][j] != '-':
                    board[i][j] = 'X'
                else:
                    board[i][j] = 'O'
                
                    
            
       

```

## [131. Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/) :star::star::star:

### DFS

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**:  Backtraking (use parition)


```python
class Solution(object):
    def partition(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: List[List[str]]
        """
        
        ans = []
        def DFS(substring,temp,ans):
            
            if len(substring) == 0:
                ans.append(temp)
                return
            
            for i in range(len(substring)):
                tempStr = substring[:i+1] 
                if tempStr == tempStr[::-1]:
                    DFS(substring[i+1:],temp+[tempStr],ans)
                    
        DFS(s,[],ans)
        return ans

```

### DP

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**:  Append new letter as you move forward


```python

```


## [134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/) :star::star:

### Greedy

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**:  Once solution of given stations is proved, any station has gas value even after deduction of cost, it is the start station.


```python

```


## [137. Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/) :star::star:

### Counter

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**:  Count every single value of number


```python

```

### Bit Manipulation


Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**:  


```python

```
