## [150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/) :star:

### Use stack

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**:  Remember negative number is not operator.

```python

```

## [152. Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/) :star::star::star:

### Kadane's algorithm

Time Complexity: $$O()$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**:  Keep track of min value too. Once min value(negavtive) is multiplied by negatvie value, it could be biggger than current max value.

```python

```

## [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/) :star::star:

### Binary Search

Time Complexity: $$O(log{n})$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**:  Use binary search. 

```python

```
## [566. Reshape the Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-the-matrix/) :star:

### Linear Matrix

Time Complexity: $$O(n)$$

Space Complexity: $$O()$$

**Key-Point**:  Handle with 1-D array.

```python

```

## [1338. Reduce Array Size to The Half](https://leetcode.com/problems/reduce-array-size-to-the-half/) :star:

### Collections.Counter

Time Complexity: $$O(nlog{n})$$

Space Complexity: $$O(n)$$

**Key-Point**:  Do not remove from list, but count.

```python

```
